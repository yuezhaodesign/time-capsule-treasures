                        I used this telephone for many years before upgrading to a smartphone. It was a landline phone that I had in my home, and I have many memories of talking to friends and family on it. It represents a simpler time when communication was more personal and deliberate. I have fond memories of using this telephone to stay connected with loved ones and make plans for the future.
